# Scarne's Dice
Scarne’s Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by
rolling a die and then: <br>
• if they roll a 1, score no points and lose their turn
• if they roll a 2 to 6, they can either:
- add the rolled value to their points, or
- choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn. 

The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 100 points.
